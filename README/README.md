CS50x Final Project

Game Recommendation System Using Steam Reviews

What will your software do?
Your project will recommend games to users based on their preferences and the sentiment of Steam reviews. Users can input a game they like, and the system will suggest similar games by analyzing reviews and game metadata.

What features will it have?
1.	Input Feature: Users can input the name of a game they like.

2.	Recommendation Feature: The system will recommend similar games based on:
    o	Game metadata (e.g., genre, tags, developer).
    o	Sentiment analysis of Steam reviews.

3.	Review Sentiment Display: For each recommended game, the system will display the overall sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) based on Steam reviews.

4.	Game Details: The system will show additional details about the recommended games, such as genre, release date, and average playtime.

How will it be executed?
1.	Data Collection:
    o	Use the Steam API or a dataset of Steam games and reviews (e.g., Kaggle datasets like "Steam Games Dataset").
    o	Extract game metadata (e.g., genre, tags) and reviews.

2.	Data Preprocessing:
    o	Clean and preprocess the reviews (e.g., remove stopwords, tokenize text).
    o	Use sentiment analysis to classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative.

3.	Recommendation System:
    o	Use collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend games based on user input.
    o	Incorporate sentiment analysis scores into the recommendation algorithm.

4.	Frontend Development:
    o	Build a simple web interface using Flask or Django.
    o	Allow users to input a game name and display recommendations with details.

5.	Backend Development:
    o	Use Python for the backend, integrating the recommendation system and sentiment analysis model.

What new skills will you need to acquire?
    •	Steam API or Dataset Handling: Learn how to fetch or use data from Steam or a dataset.
    •	Sentiment Analysis: Use libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, or Hugging Face Transformers to analyze the sentiment of reviews.
    •	Recommendation Systems: Understand collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.
    •	Web Development: Build a user-friendly interface using Flask or Django.

What topics will you need to research?
    •	How to use the Steam API or find a suitable dataset of Steam games and reviews.
    •	How to preprocess text data for sentiment analysis.
    •	How recommendation systems work and how to implement them.
    •	How to integrate a Python backend with a web frontend.

What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project?
    •	Good Outcome: The system recommends games based on metadata and displays their sentiment scores.
    •	Better Outcome: The system provides accurate and diverse recommendations, incorporating both metadata and review sentiment.
    •	Best Outcome: The system handles multiple user inputs, provides highly personalized recommendations, and displays detailed game information.

Steps to Implement the Project
1.	Data Collection:
o	Use the Steam API to fetch game data and reviews, or download a dataset like the Steam Games Dataset on Kaggle.
o	Extract relevant fields such as game name, genre, tags, reviews, and ratings.

2.	Sentiment Analysis:
o	Preprocess the reviews (e.g., remove punctuation, lowercase text, tokenize).
o	Use a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., Hugging Face's distilbert-base-uncased) or train a simple model using Scikit-learn.
o	Classify reviews as positive, neutral, or negative and calculate an overall sentiment score for each game.

3.	Recommendation System:
o	Use content-based filtering to recommend games based on metadata (e.g., genre, tags).
o	Optionally, implement collaborative filtering to recommend games based on user preferences and reviews.
o	Combine the sentiment scores with the recommendation algorithm to prioritize games with positive reviews.

4.	Frontend Development:
o	Build a web interface where users can:
	Input a game they like.
	View recommended games with details and sentiment scores.
o	Use Flask or Django for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

5.	Testing and Deployment:
o	Test the system with different inputs to ensure accurate recommendations.
o	Deploy the project locally or on a platform like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.

Example Workflow for the User
1.	The user inputs the name of a game they like (e.g., "Portal 2").

2.	The system fetches metadata and reviews for similar games (e.g., "Half-Life 2," "The Stanley Parable").

3.	The system analyzes the sentiment of reviews for each recommended game.

4.	The system displays the recommended games along with:
    o	Genre, tags, and release date.
    o	Sentiment score (e.g., 85% positive reviews).
    o	A short description of the game.

Potential Challenges and Solutions
1.	Challenge: Collecting and preprocessing Steam reviews.
    o	Solution: Use the Steam API or a pre-existing dataset to simplify data collection.
2.	Challenge: Implementing sentiment analysis.
    o	Solution: Use pre-trained models like TextBlob or Hugging Face Transformers to avoid building a model from scratch.
3.	Challenge: Building the recommendation system.
    o	Solution: Start with content-based filtering (simpler) and add collaborative filtering later if time permits.
